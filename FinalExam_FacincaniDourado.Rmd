```
We can see that there is not much change in the quantiles throughout the years, but the outliers have been less reported overtime. By checking the monthly distribution, we notice that there tends to be higher ozone concentrations in the summer, and lower ozone concentration between November and February.

```{r}
a <- ggplot(data = daily.site) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = o3, colour = `Basin Name`, alpha = 0.3)) +
   geom_hline(yintercept = 0.070, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Daily Ozone Concentration in different Air Basins in California",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Ozone Concentration (ppb)") +
  theme_bw()
a
```
The data is very dense, so we cannot see the patterns for each basin in one graph.

```{r}
#So, let's plot it separately
a1 <- ggplot(data = daily.site) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = o3)) + 
    facet_wrap(facets = vars(`Basin Name`))+
   geom_hline(yintercept = 0.070, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Daily Ozone Concentration in different Air Basins in California",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Ozone Concentration (ppb)") +
  theme_bw()
a1
```
In the graphs above, we can see that not all basins have the same trend. Some basins have large variance which is decreasing overtime, closer to the area below the standard of 0.070 ppm, 8-hour standard set by law (South Coast, Salton Sea and Mojave Desert, for example), although many times the ozone concentration has been above such standard. Other areas, tend to maintain ozone emissions below the standard (North Coast, Lake Tahoe, Northeast Plateau and Lake County). A few areas have some periods in which the standard is exceeded but we can recognize a tend of decreasing variance, maintaining the ozone emissions below 0.070 ppm recently (North Central Coast, San Francisco Bay Area and Great Basin Valleys). Other areas are showing a not-so-large variance, but that constantly exceeds the standard (such as the San Joaquin Valley, Sacramento Valley, Mountain Counties and San Diego).

All basins are very autocorrelated, and Mountain Counties, North Coast and San Diego are only positively autocorrelated.

```{r}
#Let's check out some of them more in depth

#Great Basins Valley - an example with positive and negative autocorrelation
Acf(GBV.ts, lag = 115)
Box.test(GBV.ts, lag = 115, type = "Ljung-Box")

#San Diego - am example of a positive autocorrelation
Acf(SD.ts, lag = 510)
Box.test(SD.ts, lag = 510, type = "Ljung-Box")

#San Francisco Bay Area - an example with positive and little negative autocorrelation
Acf(SFB.ts, lag = 115)
Box.test(SFB.ts, lag = 115, type = "Ljung-Box")
```
Based on the very small p-values, we can reject the null hypothesis that the time series isnâ€™t autocorrelated, as they confirm a strong autocorrelation.

Here we can see better that some time series have a lot of variance, such as the one from Northeast Plateau (with lower magnitude) and Mountain Counties (with higher magnitudes). We can also see that the variance in some time series is decreasing overtime, such as in San Diego, Mojave Desert, North Central Coast, Salton Sea and South Coast. Meanwhile, the Great Basins Valley seems to have had an increase ozone concentration recently.

Luckily, all basins have average values under the 0.07 ppm 8-hr standard. Here we can identify that the basins closer to the coast (such as the Bay Area, San Diego, North Central Coast and Norht Coast) don't have the noticeable increase in ozone concentrations during the summer that the areas more to the countryside have (such as Mountain Counties, San Joaquin Valley, Sacramento Valley and Mojave Desert).

Although there is a lot of variation in the trends in all years, we can see that there has been an upward trend in most basin in more recent years, more pronouncedly in the Great Basin Valley, Lake County, Northeas Plateau, San Francisco Bay Area, South Coast and Salton Sea. In the most recent year, however the trend follows a downward in The North Coast and North Central Coast present very similar overall responses. We can identify the influence of different seasonal patterns too, with two peaks (in the Northeast Plateu, North Coast, North Central Coast, South Central Coast, San Francisco Bay Area, for example), with one peak (Great Basins Valley, Mojave Desert, Mountain Counties, Salton Sea and San Joaquin Valley), and somewhere in between (Lake County, Lake Tahoe, South Coast and San Diego).
